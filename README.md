# Template question

Dear Supplier,

I hope this email finds you well. I am interested in placing a bulk order for clocks and came across your esteemed establishment as a reputable supplier within the UK market.

I am looking to purchase 10 units each of the 6 cheapest clock models available in your collection. It would be greatly appreciated if you could provide a quotation including the unit price, total cost, and any available discounts for bulk purchases.

Moreover, I would also like to inquire about the estimated delivery time and shipping charges to Jakarta.

I am keen to establish a fruitful business relationship and am hopeful for favorable pricing and timely delivery. I am available for further discussion at your earliest convenience. You can reach me via email or at 0987654321.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,

Reynold Smith
VP of Operations
Good Company Inc.
